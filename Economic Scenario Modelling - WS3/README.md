# Emergent Alliance - Economic Scenario Modelling

This repository contains the code used in WS3. Note that most of datasets have to be downloaded, as specified in the corresponding notebook.

## Economic documentation
These set of notebooks provide some useful code to work with Input-Output tables. All the code for our blog [Input-Output Economics and the Impact of Covid-19](https://emergentalliance.org/?p=1689) is contained in these notebooks as well. 


## Simulation engine app
We have created a web browser app provides a visual interface to our Simulation Engine - the Emergent Economic Engine. To launch the app, you need the Python package `streamlit`. You can learn more about it in its [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/). Once you have installed the package, run in your terminal the following command: `streamlit run SimEngine.py`. The app should automatically launch in your default web browser.
